# LifeSavingCode-Advanced-Operation-System
Our team is keen on leveraging data analytics and incident response concepts to create a system that makes use of web and mobile application, sensors and processors including IBM Watson Chatbot to tackle efficiency in providing relief and response to emergency situations to elderly living with no next of kin. These use cases include and are not limited to cardiac arrests, falls, unattended cooking fires etc.)  It aims to project the likelihood of a type of incident an elderly is involved in which could potentially reduce the analysis process as compared to incidents received via SCDF phone call operators that may rely on inadequate information provided by the public.
